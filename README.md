# Interview Share Canvas

Collaborative system-design interview canvas with a FastAPI backend, a static
frontend, and SQLite or PostgreSQL persistence.

## Run with Docker

Run these commands from the repository root.

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t interview-share-canvas .
```

Start the application and mount the local `data` directory for SQLite
persistence:

```bash
mkdir -p data
docker run --rm \
  --name interview-share-canvas \
  -p 8091:8091 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/data",target=/data \
  interview-share-canvas
```

Open <http://localhost:8091> in a browser.

Stop the application with `Ctrl+C`. The container is removed automatically,
but its data remains in `data/interview-share-canvas.db`. Run the same
`docker run` command to start it again with the existing data.

Inspect the database locally with:

```bash
sqlite3 data/interview-share-canvas.db
```

## Run with PostgreSQL

Docker Compose starts the application and PostgreSQL together:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8091>. PostgreSQL data is retained in the
`postgres-data` Docker volume.

Confirm both services are running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Confirm the backend is connected to PostgreSQL rather than SQLite:

```bash
docker compose exec app python -c 'from backend.main import store; print(store.engine.dialect.name); print(store.engine.url.render_as_string(hide_password=True))'
```

The first output line should be `postgresql`. Inspect the stored data with:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U interview -d interview_share_canvas
```

Then run these commands inside `psql`:

```sql
\conninfo
\dt
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM interview_sessions;
SELECT id, title, state, created_at
FROM interview_sessions
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Create or update an interview at <http://localhost:8091>, then repeat the final
query to verify that PostgreSQL accepted the change. Exit `psql` with `\q`.

View application and database logs with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app postgres
```

Stop the services with:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To also delete the PostgreSQL data and restore a fresh seeded database on the
next start, run `docker compose down --volumes`. This permanently deletes the
current Compose PostgreSQL data.

If an older standalone PostgreSQL container is using host port `5432`, find and
stop it before starting another host-exposed PostgreSQL container:

```bash
docker ps
docker stop interview-canvas-db
```

For an existing PostgreSQL server, set `DATABASE_URL` before starting the
backend:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DATABASE"
uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8091
```

## Run without Docker

Install dependencies and start the backend and frontend together:

```bash
uv sync
make run
```

Then open <http://localhost:8091>.

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest
```
